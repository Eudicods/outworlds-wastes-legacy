   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='balancing'><span class='titlemark'>8.4   </span> <a id='x9-400008.4'></a>Balancing</h4>
 
<p class='indent'>One of the goals of <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>is to foster a friendly and welcoming environment. A mix of experience
levels between commanders is expected. Here are some options to help balance tracks so game play is welcoming while also
staying fresh and challenging:

     </p><dl class='description'><dt class='description'>
 </dt><dd class='description'>
      
<p class='noindent'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Setup</span>: When setting up a track, slight preference should generally be given to the commander whose force has
     the lower total BV, including all units and pilots. For example, the commander with the lowest total BV could
     be offered the choice between attacking and defending. For a track with a terrain setup phase, the commander
     with the lowest total BV could be offered the first placement of terrain pieces.
     </p></dd><dt class='description'>
 </dt><dd class='description'>
      
<p class='noindent'><span class='ecbx-1000'>2v2</span>: Many tracks are described as 1v1; however, these tracks often support team play, such as 2 players on each
     side. When playing on teams, experience should be divided roughly equally between the two teams. Teammates
     are encouraged to collaborate on strategy for the track.

   <h4 class='subsectionHead' id='casual-tracks'><span class='titlemark'>8.5   </span> <a id='x9-410008.5'></a>Casual Tracks</h4>
 
<p class='indent'>Narrative tracks are provided by the league organizers, but <span class='ecti-1000'>BattleTech: Outworlds Wastes </span>also supports casual games
between forces. Each side must agree upon the format, scale, turn limits, and optional rules before the track
starts.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   Some sample primary objectives are included below. These scenarios generally assume a Scale 1 force and 5-7 turns of
play.
</p> 
<p class='indent'>
   </p>
   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='primary-objectives'><span class='titlemark'>8.5.1   </span> <a id='x9-420008.5.1'></a>Primary Objectives</h5>
 
<p class='indent'>
     </p><ol class='enumerate1'>
<li class='enumerate' id='x9-42002x1'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Reconnaissance</span>: The map contains 15 buildings, 7 of which contain hidden objectives. Place the buildings
     randomly or each side takes turns placing the buildings. The defender secretly rolls to determine which buildings
     hold the objectives. Attacking units may search buildings during the End Phase if they are in the target hex
     (in base to base contact) and no enemy units are in the target hex. The search is successful on a 2D6 roll of
     7+ for ’Mechs and ground combat vehicles or 5+ for infantry. An attacking unit with an active probe may
     instead search 1 building within range of its active probe on a 2D6 roll of 6+. The attacker earns 1 point for
     each objective they find and the defender earns 1 point for each objective remaining hidden.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x9-42004x2'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Supply Raid</span>: 3-7 supply depots are on the map, near the center. Each supply depot has 1-3 loads of supplies.
     Any unit with hands or cargo capacity can load supplies from the depot if they are in the same hex as a
     supply depot (in base to base contact) during the End Phase. A ’Mech with hand actuators must declare which
     hand is holding the supplies. For units with cargo capacity, a friendly infantry unit must load or unload the
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
     supplies during the End Phase. Units involved in loading or unloading supplies cannot make weapon or physical
     attacks during that turn. A ’Mech carrying supplies can’t fire arm weapons (does -2 damage). The supplies
     have negligible weight. There is no movement penalty and jumping units may still jump while carrying supplies.
     Carrying supplies does not decrease the infantry space in a combat vehicle, but all standard infantry mount
     and dismount rules still apply. ’Mechs carrying supplies in their hands may drop the supplies at any point
     during their movement. The supplies are automatically dropped if the carrying ’Mech falls or goes prone. Units
     with cargo capacity must be unloaded by a friendly infantry unit. Each side cannot retrieve more supplies from
     the same supply depot until the current supplies from that depot are scored. A unit carrying supplies earns 1
     Victory Point for bringing the supplies to their home edge.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x9-42006x3'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Zone Control</span>: 3, 5, or 7 objectives are distributed on the map. The locations of the objectives dramatically
     changes the gameplay. The basic configuration is 3 objective along the center of the map and 1 objective halfway
     between the center and each home edge. A side controls an objective if only their units are in or adjacent to the
     objective (within 2"). During the End Phase, the side that controls the most objectives earns 2 Victory Point.
     If each side controls the same number of objectives and controls at least 1 objective, then each side earns 1
     Victory Point for that round.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x9-42008x4'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Base Defense</span>: 7 buildings are on the defenders side of the map. Each building is medium with a construction
     factor of 60 (6) and 1-3 levels high (1"-3"), unless the players agree upon a different configuration. The attacker
     earns 1 Victory Point for each building destroyed and the defender earns 1 Victory Point for each building
     remaining.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x9-42010x5'><span class='ecbx-1000'>King of the Hill</span>: A hex in the center of the map contains a building with valuable files. The building is
     medium with a construction factor of 60 (6), unless the players agree upon a different configuration. The force
     earns 1 Victory Point for every turn that they have the only infantry units inside of the building at the end of
     the turn. Commanders may add additional bunkers to the center of the map.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x9-42012x6'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Assassination</span>: A VIP needs to be escorted across the battlefield. The defender selects a medium or heavy
     ’Mech from the Periphery General or Pirates list. The VIP is a Gunnery 5/ Piloting 4 (Skill 4) pilot and half of
     the adjusted BV/PV of the ’Mech counts against the defender’s BV/PV limit. The VIP’s ’Mech must cross the
     map from the defender’s home edge to the attacker’s home edge. The attacker earns 10 Victory Points if this
     ’Mech is destroyed or 5 Victory Points if this ’Mech receives crippling damage. The defender 10 Victory Points
     if this ’Mech does not receive crippling damage or 5 Victory Points if this ’Mech is crippled but not destroyed.
     The turn limit for this scenario is based upon the terrain and movement profile of the VIP’s ’Mech.
     </li>
<li class='enumerate' id='x9-42014x7'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Extraction</span>: Extract 1-3 hidden infantry teams. For each hidden unit, the attackers select a hex within 4 rows
     (8") of the defenders home edge and more than 4 hexes (8") away from the other edges of the map. A unit
     with at least 1 ton of cargo capacity can pick up the target by being in the same hex as a target during the
     End Phase. The target is not destroyed if the carrying unit is destroyed. The attackers earn 1 Victory Point
     for each team extracted and the defenders earn 1 Victory Point for each extraction prevented.
     </li>
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
<li class='enumerate' id='x9-42016x8'><span class='ecbx-1000'>Recovery</span>: 4-6 disabled ’Mechs are equally spaced along the map diagonal. A unit of equal or higher weight
     class can drag a target ’Mech. A friendly unit must be in the same hex (in base to base contact) as the target
     ’Mech during the End Phase to start dragging it. Units without hand actuators must use 1 turn securing the
     target ’Mech. The dragging unit has a 1/2 reduction in their walking MP and cannot jump. A target ’Mech
     cannot fire weapons in one arm (does -1 damage). A unit earns Victory Points based upon the Alpha Strike
     size category of ’Mech returned to their home map edge.

   <h5 class='subsubsectionHead' id='additional-options'><span class='titlemark'>8.5.2   </span> <a id='x9-430008.5.2'></a>Additional Options</h5>
 
<p class='indent'>This list of casual objectives is not exhaustive. Commanders may develop and play alternative tracks as long as the tracks are
not intended to cheat the spirit of the rules or otherwise give the commanders unfair advantages. Commanders are
encouraged to develop tracks that match the lore of their forces. For example, a pair of commanders for Clan forces may
agree to a Trial of Possession or a commander of a Solaris VII force may challenge another force to a televised
duel.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   These objectives may be adapted to best support the narrative the players are creating, as long as all commanders agree.
Any additional restrictions or conditions for the track need to be agreed upon by all commanders before the track starts. The
outcome of the track may result in transfer of SP, personnel, or units between forces if that is agreed upon before the track
starts.
</p> 
<p class='noindent'>   These alternative tracks may include an SP payment but do not have to. If the track includes an SP payment, it
should stay close to the 100% Base Pay limit for the Scale. If the track is smaller than Scale 1, reduce the
payment accordingly. For example, a duel between two 1,500 BV ’Mechs could have prize of 250 SP for the
winner.
